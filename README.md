Kaart Keyboard
===================

An iOS custom keyboard extension written in Swift designed to make text input in Go Map!! faster and more accurate.

## Accented Character Usage
1. Long press on base character to show accented characters
2. To make the accented characters go away either:
   
   a. Click on one of the accented characters
   
   b. Double click the base character



## Accented Character Notes
If you are editing one of the shortcut words and summon accented characters, the accented characters will cover the text box only until you dispose of the accented characters using either method described above.

## Paste usage while editing shortcut words
Once the desired text is copied, long press on the text field to paste -- there won't be any indicator other than the text showing up.
